## How will someone control your car?
We had first decided to control the car with a RF system. Due to reasons explained later, we could not create and implement a RF system. We then tried and researched to use a bluetooth module, again this did not work out. Finally the decision was made to use a wifi module.
## How will your car respond to controls?
Using the WiFi module, we will create a server hosted on the Arduino and connect via mobile phone. This website will contain the cotrols for the car. The car will be rear wheel drive to allow for the ackerman steering system.
## How do you integrate solutions?
We will create and finish many smaller components, when they are done we will combine them together to create a working RC car. Starting with the design, server, 3d print a structure for the car, setup the motors and make them controllable via the server.
